Description:

The goal of this project was to build a timed multiple choice quiz application. This required a lot of JavaScript logic to take place with a lot of different parameters and conditional statements. This quiz will initialize once the 'Play Game' button is clicked and proceeds to give the player 60 seconds to answer 5 questions. Each question answered correctly increments a score (not displayed until the end) and any incorrect answers will decrement the alloted time (visible in the top right corner). The game is over when all the questions are answered or when the user runs out of time. At the conclusion of the game the player will see a form to enter in their name/moniker next to their score. They will then see a published highscore leaderboard that uses local storage to save and pull this data up on the browser. The highscore leaderboard can be viewed independently by clicking on 'Highscores' in the top left corner.
